# Security of Systems â€“ First Force Project

A sophisticated distributed security platform that seamlessly integrates multiple cutting-edge technologies to deliver comprehensive surveillance capabilities. The system implements a modern microservices architecture with real-time communication channels between components, featuring a hybrid communication model where REST APIs handle administrative operations and MQTT provides real-time messaging.

## Project Overview

This project represents a comprehensive security monitoring system with the following key features:
- Real-time photo capture from security devices with OCR text extraction
- Advanced search capabilities based on extracted text content
- Multi-platform access through web interface and Android application
- Device management and control with role-based access
- Secure communication with TLS encryption
- Containerized deployment with Docker Swarm

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of five primary components working in concert:

* **Client Application**: A responsive React-based web interface that provides administrators and security personnel with an intuitive dashboard for monitoring, search operations, and system configuration.

* **Server Backend**: Powered by Go for maximum performance and concurrency, the server handles authentication, device management, image processing, and serves as the central coordination point for the entire system.

* **Android Application**: A native Kotlin mobile client that extends monitoring capabilities to on-the-go scenarios, allowing remote system control from the UI.

* **MQTT Broker**: Facilitates lightweight, real-time bidirectional communication between system components using the publish-subscribe pattern, enabling status updates with minimal latency.

* **Storage Layer**: Combines MongoDB's flexible document storage for metadata and event information with S3-compatible object storage for efficient management of captured images.

## Core Features

### Real-time Monitoring
- Live view of device feeds with mode switching
- Real-time status updates via MQTT protocol
- Instant device registration and disconnection detection

### Text-based Search
- OCR processing using Tesseract to extract text from images
- Search photos by extracted text content
- Advanced filtering by date, device, and text content

### Multi-platform Access
- Web interface for desktop administration
- Android application for mobile monitoring
- Consistent user experience across platforms

### Device Management
- Device registration and state tracking
- Mode switching between Normal and Live operation
- Role-based access control (Admin/User permissions)

### Security Features
- TLS encryption for all communications
- JWT-based authentication
- Certificate-based MQTT security
- Role-based access control

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technologies | Responsibilities |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Client | React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS | User interface, photos search, device settings management |
| Server | Go, AWS SDK, MongoDB | Backend, coordination, authentication |
| Android App | Kotlin | Mobile interface, real-time and on-command photos |
